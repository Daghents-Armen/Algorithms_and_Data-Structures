# Algorithms_and_Data-Structures
This repository contains implementations of essential data structures and algorithms. Designed as a reference for learning, coding interviews, and problem-solving practice.

1 Bubble sort - is a simple comparison-based algorithm where adjacent elements are repeatedly compared and swapped if they are 
the a wrong order. The process continues until no swaps are needed, meaning the array is sorted.

2 Insertion sort - works by dividing the array into a 'sorted' and 'unsorted' part. One by One, elements from the unsorted part are picked and inserted into their correct position in the sorted part.

3 Selection Sort - works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part and placing it at the beginning of the array.

4 Counting Sort - is not comparison-based. Instead, it counts the occurrences of each distinct element and uses this information to place elements in the correct position. It works best for small ranges of integers.
